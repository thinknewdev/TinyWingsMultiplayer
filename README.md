Multiplayer Mobile Rendition of Tiny Wings Concept


This project is the IOS version of a cordova / PhoneGap project implementing Now.JS before it died.  This also implements several other native phone features such as SMS invites, email invites, and Facebook invites.

It is over a year old, so some APIs have been updated and this is up for others to learn from the concepts implemented here.
